                          | WELCOME TO THE POSBOX ! |
                          +-------------------------+

The posbox should mostly run by itself, so if you've found yourself here, you 
are probably interested in hacking it, etc. Here is a quick overview of how it 
works:

The posbox uses odoo as a web server to proxy request from the point of sale
to python driver modules. The main driver modules are hw_proxy, hw_escpos, and
hw_scanner.

The odoo server is installed in ~/odoo

The openerp server is managed with the odoo.service systemd unit. That unit
can be found in /etc/systemd/system/odoo.service. Systemd is used to automati-
cally start openerp at boot and restart it in case of failure.

For those unfamiliar with systemd you'll find help scripts in the ~/odoo/posbox
directory that help you start / restart / stop or update odoo

~/odoo is a git repository tracking the "posbox" branch of the 
github.com/odoo/odoo.git repository. The "posbox" branch is forked off the 
master branch and contains files specific to the posbox. The update mechanism 
on the posbox simply does a git pull on the posbox branch, updates the db and 
restarts the server.

Some people are confused by the fact that odoo is running on the posbox. To
be perfectly clear, There is no business data on the posbox, and we could have 
used any other web server to implement the posobx. We used openerp simply to 
reuse a technology that was familiar to us instead of introducing a new one.
